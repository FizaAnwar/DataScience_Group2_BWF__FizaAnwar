        "Task 29-> Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques\n",
        "When working on a machine learning project, selecting and fine-tuning the right model is essential for optimal performance. Common models from sklearn include Linear Regression for predicting continuous values, Logistic Regression for binary classification, and Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, and KNNs for various classification and regression tasks. Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization can be employed to find the best parameters for these models, enhancing their performance and predictive accuracy. Apply these techniques and note down the results to evaluate the impact of different models and hyperparameters on your dataset's performance."
